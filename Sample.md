***Summary***

My mock interview was conducted with a help of my friend Eric Wu.
As he is my close friend, I could practice my mock interview in a comfortable way.
Because of that, I could speak well I prepared for the answers. However, for some questions that I did prepare less, I felt it is pretty hard to answer, and this made me think I need to prepare my sample answers for more questions.
I learned that the more prepared, the more I can answer fluently and confidently. I think this will help me a lot at the real interview.
By taking mock interview practice, it gave me a confidence that I can improve my interview skills by taking more mock interview with various people.
